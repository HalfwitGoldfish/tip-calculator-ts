Peer Review: Everything looks great! I'd say it's pretty accurate to the original design, I like how you have the ability to tick up the inputs it's a neat addition. The only thing I can say is that the reset button doesn't become "active" in the sense of changing color when all the fields are completed, but it is functional! Other than that it's all looking good and I like how you did it using typescript!
